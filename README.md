**•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

My main strategy for writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is to keep things simple. For maintainability, that means trying to keep each function confined to one assignment. Also, since we were using Python, I include the parameter and return data types. I find this useful in keeping me from having to track down what exactly I’m working with and expected to return. Finally, I try to keep my functions in a logical order to keep from wasting time scrolling through the code.

For readability, I like to name my variables and functions in a descriptive and unambiguous way. I’m fully on board with the idea that good code should be relatively self-explanatory. The same goes for comments – short and to the point.
For adaptability, I try to make functions that can be used as widely as possible for their purpose. For this specific project, that meant being able to perform the CRUD operations on one or many documents at a time.

The big advantage in working this way was it was easy to add to, then implement my code each week. This CRUD Python module could be used to create future dashboards for real world applications. I intend to use it in my capstone course to further improve the depth of my dashboard.

**•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

My basic strategy when it comes to approaching a problem is to review the requirements, formulate a solution on paper, code the solution, then evaluate the requirements again to ensure they were met. Within that there are a fair number of incremental changes and testing to ensure that each change produces the desired result. For this project, that meant adding one dashboard element at a time, adjusting it, ensuring it worked correctly, then moving on to the next element.
I’ve been using this strategy for all my courses, and it has proven to be effective. In creating databases in the future, I would take the same tack of reviewing requirements, sketching out a solution, then incrementally implementing that solution.

**•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists take problems and develop solutions to those problems. Withing the scope of Grazioso Salvare, their problem was organizing their data into an easily searchable dashboard. Now they can focus on their core business because of the tools we’ve provided.
